# LightspeedPlugin
An [AssettoServer](https://github.com/compujuckel/AssettoServer) plugin made for Lightspeed, an [Assetto Corsa](https://assettocorsa.gg/) server which has since been closed.

This plugin was not made for public use and will not be optimized for such. ~It's a work in progress and I plan to extend on it~. Feel free to use it at your own discresion while respecting the license.

### What does this plugin do?
So far the only real purpose of this plugin is to save driving statistics for clients. Details such as time spent driving, distance driven, and top speed are calculated and saved. Once a client leaves, the server will "queue" the statistics of that clients' session to be added up with any other entries. Calculating the `MostCommonDriver` for a model is yet to be completed.
